Why magic? 
------------
Extremely fast,extensible and common game server development is really hard, is there a framework which can cover the mojarity scenes of game? Maybe the only answer will be Magic.With Magic Framework you can build games like：WoW, Dota, DNF, Hearthstone, Online-Poker, Social-Game etc.
